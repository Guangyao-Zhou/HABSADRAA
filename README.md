# HABSADRAA
The code for A Hybrid Solution for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis using Double Rotatory Attention Adjustment model
## Software
The HABSADRAA source code: https://github.com/ofwallaart/HAABSA and https://github.com/mtrusca/HAABSA_PLUS_PLUS need to be installed. Then, 
-Update the config.py, main.py.
-Add files:
 - Double rotatory attention Adjustment model:
   - lcrDoubleRAA 
The training and testing databases are SemEval 2015 and SemEval 2016. The files are available for BERT word emebddings.
## Word embeddings
 - BERT word embeddings (SemEval 2015): https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-P1LjDfwPhlt3UZhFIcdLQyEHFuorokx/view?usp=sharing
